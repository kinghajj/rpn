The idea of this branch is to separate the console-related modules so that,
perhaps, a GUI could be more easily added.

Files that should definitely move to a console/ directory:

	arguments.c
	error.c
	help.c
	rpn.c

Even though some files, like commands.c and operators.c, are rather console-
oriented, a GUI could just use RPN_eval() to interact with these in response to
user input.
