The idea of this branch is to separate the console-related modules so that,
perhaps, a GUI could be more easily added.

Files that should definitely move to a console/ directory:

	arguments.c
	error.c
	help.c
	rpn.c

Even though some files, like commands.c and operators.c, are rather console-
oriented, a GUI could just use RPN_eval() to interact with these in response to
user input.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think this is basically done, though the separation could probably be more
complete. Whenever I try to add a GUI, I'll probably see what I've forgetten
now. I won't merge this back into master, however, until I get a PSP dev setup
again and make sure the PSP port still works.
